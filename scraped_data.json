There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to implementing a marketplace or dropship strategy, so retailers shared slightly different approaches to test, learn, and drive growth at their business using one or both platform models.",

We know we're experts, that's what our editors are,” says Jeanne Barrueta, senior vice president of marketplace at Hearst. “That's where the marketplace came into the picture and we developed  a platform that more deeply integrates with sellers, we can get better product data, real-time pricing, and start to surface a lot of that information to our customers.”",
                "The most successful marketplace and dropship programs aren’t built and run in silos. British fashion retailer ASOS, for example, illustrated how a marketplace model helps their team expand assortment across their entire digital business and increase profitability at scale, and with less risk.",
                "“From a marketplace perspective, it will enhance our profitability of our wholesale businesses as well, where we're not taking those bets to buy that product,” said Chris Peduto, head of partnership management at ASOS.",
                "A marketplace model enables ASOS to test and learn the new products and styles that customers want to buy, so they can adjust their buying decisions accordingly. By employing innovative strategies and leveraging technology, ASOS has carved out a distinct space in the market, offering a seamless shopping experience and a vast selection of products.",

                "“At Secret Sales we have 2,000 brands and growing every month. We are launching retail media because how are we going to make sure that each brand that comes on is appearing in front of the right customer and enough customers?” said Ekow Mensah, vice president of retail media at Secret Sales. “The benefit of starting retail media for our brands is that we can make sure brands large and small are all getting visibility across different customers.”",
                "By leveraging data and technology, Secret Sales can optimize ad placements and improve the overall shopping experience for their customers. This strategic move not only supports brand growth but also enhances customer loyalty and satisfaction.",

                "BOSTON – MAY 20, 2024– Mirakl, the global leader in eCommerce platform business innovation, announced its 2024 Marketplace and Dropship Index, that includes a detailed analysis of 118 global retail marketplaces and dropship platforms, representing more than $6 billion in marketplace and dropship sales, more than 66,000 third-party sellers, and just under 200 million unique products.",

                "Retailers look for new ways todrive growth and maintain marginsas profitability pressures become the new normal.",
                "As the platform model becomes more popular among operators and sellers, and more retailers and brands become sellers themselves, the importance ofquality seller onboardingis growing.",
                "As customers push for more personalized shopping experience,curated platformsare gaining ground against their generalist competitors, with some industries seeing growth as high as 74%.",
                "Businesses feel the pressure to maximize profits by refining their operations across brick-and-mortar and eCommerce channels. Unowned inventory strategies, marketplace and dropship platforms, offer a clear path to profitability that drives growth with new and existing customers, in an asset-light and low-risk way.",
                "This pressure is why we are seeing dramatic adoption of marketplace models from major retailers(Mirakl’s customers)like Anthropologie, Bloomingdale’s, Asos, H&M, J. Crew Group, Macy’s, Shop Premium Outlets, Urban Outfitters. These household names are counting on the platform model for continued success.",
                "“We want to empower our customers to shop a unique selection of meaningful products and brands. We need a scalable solution that can match our brand DNA. Our drop shipment strategy helps us to become the leading, curated, multi-brand destination for style, creativity, and culture,” saysMarie Liedholm, global head of new business, at H&M.",
                "Sellers and suppliers are the backbone of marketplace and dropship businesses. Last year saw an impressive 18.9% surge in the number of active sellers across various marketplaces.",
                "The continuous growth of online marketplaces underscores the importance of a high-quality seller onboarding experience. When sellers are equipped with the right strategies and tools for success, they can deliver enhanced value to the platform operator – and expand into more marketplace and dropship channels. As marketplace and dropship strategies mature, companies are increasingly investing in seller experience by offering dedicated operator support to ensure transparent, ongoing communication, personalized assistance, and clear product data guidelines. Robust technology, including advancements in AI, are improving integrations, reducing workloads, and even eliminating the manual process of category and attribute mapping.",
                "Average total sales per active seller increased by 20.2% in 2023, reflecting the impact of these investments by marketplace and dropship businesses. The growing number of total products offered in online marketplaces also reflects the growth of platform ecosystems, enabling competitive pricing and convenience for customers.",
                "In 2023, the total number of products offered across Mirakl-powered marketplaces grew by 44.8%. In many cases, multiple sellers offered the same product, driving more competitive pricing for consumers: according to Mirakl research, there was an average of 1.56 comparative options per product.",
                "For years, the most well-known marketplaces were eCommerce giant “generalists”: platforms like Amazon and eBay that present themselves as “everything stores” with offerings across hundreds of categories. However, specialized marketplaces are attracting more shoppers. Research from Boston Consulting Group revealed that 63% of consumers would prefer to shop from specialized retailers, signaling an ongoing opportunity for more curated shopping experiences.",
                "While platform businesses as a whole grew by 46.2% in 2023, industry-specific marketplaces in the fashion, electronics, sporting goods, and home/DIY sectors all grew at even higher rates. In particular, electronics (62.5%) and sporting goods (74.6%) saw dramatic growth.",
                "Pressure on profitability was the overarching theme for retailers in 2023, and that pressure extended beyond simply improving margins through marketplace and dropship sales.",
                "Online retailers explored new ways to establish additional revenue streams. Following the example set by industry titans like Amazon and Walmart, more mature marketplaces began to introduce retail media to further monetize their marketplaces.",
                "The appeal is easy to understand. According to Boston Consulting Group, retail media offers profit margins ranging from 70% to 90%. The rise of AI-powered retail media technology, like Mirakl Ads, is making retail media even more compelling for retailers, delivering a higher return on advertising spend (ROAS) for advertisers, while also optimizing for the highest profitability rate possible for the publisher.",

Nearly two-thirds of business buyers (64%) today are millennial or Gen Z, and they’re reshaping the B2B industry. The new generation of buyers all expect a seamless buying experience with access to digital catalogs, diverse product ranges, transparent availability & pricing, and rich product data.",
                "For wholesalers, offering a seamless experience isn’t easy. Handling the efficient management of hundreds of suppliers and their product catalogs, at scale, is one of the biggest barriers they face. Inconsistent data, low data quality, and varying formats make it difficult to manage an accurate digital catalog online effectively.",
                "With70%of buyers saying that richness of product information and imagery is key for them, supplier catalog onboarding is much more than just an operational challenge. It’s the number one issue that distributors face today.",

                "As product assortment grows, wholesalers are now managing hundreds of suppliers and millions of SKUs, pushing the limits of what they can do manually. Suppliers often have varying categories and formats, provide 200+ product attributes per SKU, and exhibit significant differences in their levels of maturity and integration methods, such as online forms, bulk import, API, and FTP.",
                "According toMcKinsey & Company, it often takes 10-15 interactions with each supplier to launch a single SKU, with 2-5 hours spent verifying product data per SKU. This involves numerous manual collaboration processes, and communications via emails, phone calls, and file exchanges, complicating creates and you have a recipe for extremely complicated data collection and collaboration",
                "💡Did you know? The average wholesale distributor faces 15,000 issues with inaccurate product data per year",
                "These challenges can negatively impact the business and contribute to:",

                "Poor Customer Experience: Incomplete or inaccurate product data not only leads to low conversion rates but also high return rates due to incorrect information, compounding operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, buyers expect detailed product descriptions and the ability to filter by attributes; failing to meet these expectations, as noted by Forrester, where 71% of shoppers expect basic attribute filtering, results in dissatisfaction and lost sales.",
                "To address the numerous challenges associated with supplier catalog onboarding, Mirakl has developed theMirakl Catalog Platform (MCP). This powerful solution streamlines the entire process of product data collection and integration, ensuring faster onboarding and superior product data quality. The Mirakl Catalog Platform is the entry point for product data from suppliers, providing a seamless interface where suppliers can autonomously import their catalogs and map their data formats to align with your business requirements.",
                "Within the Mirakl Catalog Platform, users can validate content, request supplier modifications, and leverage OpenAI to automatically enrich product details. Once validated, it effortlessly integrates product data into various internal systems, such as PIMs, MDMs, and ERPs, via its robust integration capabilities.",
                "Additionally, Mirakl Catalog Platform helps: Distributors and wholesalers can easily set up data modeling rules, so that suppliers can autonomously input information that meets their taxonomy needs and quality standards.",
                "Suppliers have multiple upload options like API, FTP, .xls, .XML, csv, or manual uploads, catering to varied supplier requirements at scale. MCP automatically maps native supplier format with the operator’s taxonomy.",
                "Suppliers receive automatic alerts about missing data based on the business rules set by the wholesalers and distributors, minimizing the need for manual interactions and ensuring content completeness.",
                "Upon receiving product data, wholesalers and distributors only need to approve it to trigger sending the content to their internal systems. They can also enrich the data using the built-in OpenAI capabilities of Mirakl and integrate other content syndication tools.",

This allows businesses to focus their efforts on expanding and refining their product offerings, rather than managing supplier communications for data corrections. The Mirakl Catalog Platform is an ideal solution for eCommerce wholesale distributors, retailers, and GPOs with extensive supplier networks.",
                "Choosing to integrate Mirakl MCP into a digital strategy is not merely about adopting a new tool. It’s about taking a faster, more efficient approach that enables wholesalers to launch and expand their eCommerce business efficiently. Meeting buyer expectations for comprehensive product information, competitive pricing, and assured availability is just the first step.",
